Hi! I’m Anett, a freelance software developer with years of experience writing thoughtful, clean, and well-documented code that stands the test of time – mainly in Python and Rust. I prefer working remotely, whether independently or collaborating with others, and I enjoy being part of international teams.

With a solid background in Natural Language Processing (NLP), I’ve worked on a range of diverse projects, from improving chatbots to developing tools for spelling correction.

I’ve also expanded my expertise in web development, and Django has become my framework of choice. Whether it's user-friendly backends or complex data analysis, I love building robust and flexible solutions.

Software development is a constantly evolving field, always bringing new challenges. I’m always open to learning new technologies and methods if they can benefit a project or make a solution more efficient.

In addition to my professional work, I enjoy creating my own small software projects, which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/noeddl/).

If you're looking for a reliable developer who brings technical expertise and attention to detail to your projects, I’d love to hear from you.
